  5  1  4  2  8
Step 1:
  Selected index: vec[0] = 5
    vec[1] = 1 is the minimum.
    SWAP.
  Vector after Step 1:
  1  5  4  2  8
Step 2:
  Selected index: vec[1] = 5
    vec[3] = 2 is the minimum.
    SWAP.
  Vector after Step 2:
  1  2  4  5  8
Step 3:
  Selected index: vec[2] = 4
    vec[2] = 4 is the minimum.
    No swap. The selected index is the minimum.
